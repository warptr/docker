## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with GitLab, here's a list of recommended next steps.

Already a pro? Just edit this README.md and make it your own. Want to make it easy? [Use the template at the bottom](#editing-this-readme)!

## Add your files

* [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/web_editor/#create-a-file) or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/web_editor/#upload-a-file) files
* [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/topics/git/add_files/#add-files-to-a-git-repository) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://jihulab.com/tmzg0000/docker.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

## Integrate with your tools

* [Set up project integrations](https://jihulab.com/tmzg0000/docker/-/settings/integrations)

## Collaborate with your team

* [Invite team members and collaborators](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/members/)
* [Create a new merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests/)
